HeyðŸ‘‹

My name is Mihajlo. I'm a skilled digital analytics and product specialist. I worked with some great teams at Sunsuper, REIQ and Vroom to optimise the experience and increase website conversion.

> ### What is vergeCo?

This is my personal site where I can experiment with technology, analytics and content. It's also a place where I write notes and articles about things that interest me. You'll find posts about scaling businesses, product management, digital analytics and growth strategies.

## Work with me

I like using a range of tools and frameworks, from A/B testing and SEO tools to more abstract things like [Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) and[ Jobs To be Done](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/jobs-to-be-done/) principles.

If you'd like to get in touch with me you can send me an [email](mailto:mihajlo@hey.com), follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/naumovic) or check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naumovic/).

> ### What is the technology behind this site?

The technology powering this site is a mix of templates using React frameworks, Gatsby and Netlify CMS. It's essentially a web app built to run fast and still utilise templates to make it easier to update content.
