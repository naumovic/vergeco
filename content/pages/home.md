Hey👋

My name is Mihajlo. I'm a skilled digital analytics and product specialist. I worked with some amazing teams at Sunsuper, REIQ and Vroom to optimise the experience and increase performance.

> ### What is vergeCo?

This is my personal site where I can experiment with technology, analytics and content. It's also a place where I write notes and articles about things that interest me. You'll find posts about scaling businesses, product management, digital analytics and growth strategies.

## Work with me

I like using a range of tools and frameworks, from A/B testing and SEO tools to more abstract things like Design Thinking and Jobs To be Done principles.

If you'd like to get in touch with me you can send me an [email](mailto:mihajlo@hey.com), follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/naumovic) or check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naumovic/).

> ### What is the technology behind this site?

The technology powering this site is a mix of templates using React frameworks, Gatsby and Netlify CMS. It's essentially a web app built to run fast and still utilise templates to make it easier to update content.
