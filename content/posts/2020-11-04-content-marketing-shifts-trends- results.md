It was refreshing to see a bunch of passionate content marketers share some awesome tips and [super-actionable items at a local event](https://www.interactiveminds.com/events/details/interactive-minds-brisbane-presents-content-marketing-shifts-trends-results). Here are my top takeaways.

### The Tools

Nice set of tools and tips for content marketing team:

1. [Answer the public](https://answerthepublic.com/)

3. Use Google Ads Keyword planner
4. Look at featured snippet + people also searched for

### **Wow Metrics**

The obvious metrics (i.e time on page) are not always the best ones

Important metrics for podcasts: listening length, new subscribers and shares. Different to blog posts — Wow score

* Active users reading time
* Scroll time
* Article length

Keep it simple sweetheart! KISS

Attribution: watch out for assisted conversions

### Conversions

While focusing the campaign on brand awareness — you can still get the conversion uptake, again and again there are cases in point.

Re-purposing good content: from initial info-> social snippets -> animated (short segment)

### Video

Finding volunteers to interview can snowball as they influence others people who would like airtime. So you can get a perpetual source of content.

Video tools — easy video setup for getting started with decent video content:

* DJI Osmo
* Cannon 70D
* Microphone pack
* Final Cut Pro

### Big Picture — the Why

Find your why before you start pumping out content-> An example for a business to business product can be as simple as: We help businesses succeed!

### Segmentation

* Find who’s going to buy
* Personas->[JTBD](https://www.amazon.com.au/Competing-Against-Luck-Innovation-Customer/dp/0062435612)
* Analytics 360 Dashboard
* Re-targeting: cool trial with re-purposing blog post into short video->re target to those who played for more than 10 seconds + CTA go to the blog = great success
* Find content that really helps you
* Work with freelancers to find new angles

### Choosing your metrics based on the journey phase

**Acquisition**

* Audience size (owned/paid/earned)
* Total new users or unique pageviews per user
* Social engagement (affinity/applause) rate
* Social reach

**Behaviour**

* Remarketing audience size or performance (incremental improvements)

**Conversion**

* Sales and revenue
* Conversions (e.g. sign-ups, phone calls, location page views)

**Advocacy**

* Social mentions and conversion rate
* Referral traffic

### Building an Audience

Content has to be so good to give information back to us in advertising

### Love the Creativity, INC quote!

[**Content Marketers Need to Act Like Publishers**\
*One of the biggest cop-outs in corporate life is to say, "We had a great strategy, but we just couldn't execute it."…*hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2016/03/content-marketers-need-to-act-like-publishers "https\://hbr.org/2016/03/content-marketers-need-to-act-like-publishers")[](https://hbr.org/2016/03/content-marketers-need-to-act-like-publishers)
